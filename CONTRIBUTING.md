# Contributions

We'd love to accept any PRs, suggestions, issues, or contributions to this project! There are just a few small things you need to do first.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

## What should I contribute?

Once you've submitted a CLA, please feel free to put up a PR adding any third-party tools to the `src/tools/index.json` file. If you would like to modify anything else with the site (including adding newer tool categories), please put up an issue first so we can chat about it!
