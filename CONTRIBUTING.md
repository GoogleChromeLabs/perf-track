# Contributions

We'd love to accept any PRs, suggestions, issues, or contributions to this project! There are just a few small things you need to do first.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

## What should I contribute?

Once you've submitted a CLA, please submit a PR or take a look at the [issues list](/issues) to find out ways to help! If you have new ideas that you would like to see, create a new issue so we can discuss.
